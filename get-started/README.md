# Get Started with Gloo Gateway
This section runs through the [Get Started](https://docs.solo.io/gateway/latest/quickstart/) documentation and vets all permutations described in the documentation.  If you want to simply instantiate a Gloo Gateway for your cluster, then run any of the installation scripts in this directory.  This will install Gloo Gateway along with httpbin and setup basic routing.

The scripts here presume you have an available cluster without Gloo Gateway installed.  See the [demo-infrastructure](https://github.com/solo-io/demo-infrastructure) repo if you need help getting started.

## Testing
Run `chainsaw test` to execute tests.
