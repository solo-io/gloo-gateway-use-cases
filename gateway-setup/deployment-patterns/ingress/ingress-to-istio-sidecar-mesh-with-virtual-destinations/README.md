In this section, you will need to have a 3-cluster setup.  The chainsaw tests will create them for you with k3d.  See `scripts/preflight.sh` for more information on how this works.

You will need to run these tests with the `--no-cluster` option so that chainsaw can create the clusters during the initial test.
